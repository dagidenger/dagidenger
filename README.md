The story talks about a kid who lives in an imagination world that he created because he thinks the world is to boring to just be lived in. While he is going to sleep he notices
that the monsters in his imagination have set out to attack him. Now he is confroted with his own idea that imaginatiions aren't real so that he could go to sleep peacefully.
